This folder contains some tests using the CM_CLIENT from the command line.

In order to run the tests execute './runTestWithoutFootprint.sh'.

The tests are not executed during the maven build since the test relies on
a backend which must be available in order to run the tests.

The tests are intened for being triggered manually.
